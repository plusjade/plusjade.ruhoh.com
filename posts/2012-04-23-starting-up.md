### My Startup Idea:

A Blog hosting service where anybody can create a blog and publish content online.
We will compete with Wordpress and tumblr.com

### Purpose

SuperBlog allows users to easily publish content to the internet without any technical knowledge required.

### Requirements

Here's a quick list of what specifically SuperBlog will need to do:

A user should be able to...

- sign up and instantly have a blog hosted online at username.superblog.com
- specify his own domain name.
- fully customize the look of his blog.
- create posts via an admin panel.
- upload pictures to his posts via admin panel.
- send and email to superblog and have it publish the contents as a post.
- view his page visits via his admin panel.
- receive emails when visitors comment on his blog posts.
- export his blog data in order to back it up.

A superadmin should be able to...

- charge users for their blog subscriptions on recurring basis.
- send out a newsletter to all blog user accounts.
- disable access (but not delete) accounts that violate the TOS or are passed due on their payment.


A blog reader should be able to...

- Read a user blog via a website or mobile device.
- Comment on a blog post.
- Subscribe to a blog.
- Create a reader account to manage subscriptions and comments.
- Share a blog post via a social networking service like twitter or FB.
