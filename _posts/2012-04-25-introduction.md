### Purpose

The purpose of this book is to help you gain a sufficient understanding
of how a modern web application works. 

You will understand the core concepts enough to formulate a working picture in your head.
Think of your understanding of how a car works. Most people understand the basic premise of a car.
An internal combustion engine turns gas explosions into rotational energy via the transmission which turns the wheels.

It is less important that you know the physics behind it, and each minute component; you don't want to be a mechanic, but it is an important life-skill
to be able to understand what a mechanic is _telling you_.

### Goals

- Understand _what_ a web application is.
- Understand _where_ web applications run and why it is crucial to design for and expect multi-environment usage.
- Understand _how_ a web application is structured, and the various components needed to build a robust application.
- Understand _why_ a web application is built the way it is and the underlying principles we strive to align to.
- Understand _who_ is needed to build a web application in terms of "roles", how those roles work together in a typical development process.

The above goals are meant to provide you a conceptual model of the principles of web application design.

Like learning a language, it is best to understand the underlying rules of the language.
Once you understand the syntax and grammar, learning the language becomes a matter of learning the words.
Toward that end, the glossary contains tons of keywords available for your reference. Use this as a guide to
help you engage in better understanding a technical conversation should you find yourself engaged in one =)


### How this Book Works

To accomplish the aforementioned goals, I plan to outline an example startup idea for a web application.
I'll take you step by step from startup idea to the technical implementation of the working web app.

The startup example will be deliberately simple but but rest assured _every_ underlying concept covered will be
widely applicable to many different types of applications serving many different purposes.

#### Problems and Solutions

It is important to understand that all web applications are based on the premise of _solving a problem_.
We can frame any idea for an app, product, or service in terms of a _solution to a problem_.
For example the development of Wikipedia solve the problem of a user needing free and open access to an explanation of a topic.
Google.com was created to solve the problem of finding better quality content on the internet.

As we step through the creation of a web application we will do so in terms of _problems and solutions_.
That is to say a natural problem will arise during our development process, and we will work out a solution 
to the problem by means of applying a core concept or component.

I use this method because it focuses on the most important part of why you care about technology in the first place.
Technology solves problems, it really is as simple as that.

I promise you this will be very straightforward and easy to understand.
The details are what make technology hard. We will not be covering any details, only core, fundamental understanding!
