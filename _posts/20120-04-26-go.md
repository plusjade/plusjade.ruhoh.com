# Introduction

What is a web application? Let's break that question down into its core parts:


## What is an Application?

An application is a computer software program designed for the user to perform a task.
Excel, word, photoshop are examples of _desktop_ applications.
Wikipedia, google, facebook, twitter are examples of _web_ applications, that is they exist and work primarily online.
Most web applications also have mobile apps, an application that you have to install on your phone or tablet is a _mobile_ application.

Desktop, web, iphone, Android, ipad, are examples of physical environments where applications run.
It is important to understand that applications must be created to work in the specific environment
they will run on. Creating a an app that runs on an android phone will not run on an iphone or on your laptop for example.

The Internet provides the first-ever cross-environment application environment,
it's why you want to create a modern web application of course!

The environment matters each environment can only understand certain languages and tools.
Therefore if you want your application to run on a particular environment, you have to build it _specifically for that environment_.

One reason why the internet is so popular is because it is accessible within the most environments.
Web applications are most commonly accessed via a web-browser. a web-browser exists on desktops, phones, and tablets. 
This means your single web app can work across all these environments without any extra work.


## What is the web?

In a nutshell the Internet is a network of computers. 
Any computer can be connected directly or indirectly to the Internet including your personal desktop or laptop computer.

The computers connected to the Internet can make certain content publicly accessible to other computers in the network (on the Internet).
They can also receive content that other computer's make available.

A **server** is a computer that has been tuned to serve content on the Internet in an efficient manner.
Servers use the same basic hardware as any normal computer including your laptop, the difference lies mainly in the configuration of the software.

FWIW you can technically serve a website to the entire planet using only your personal laptop computer - the principles are the same, only the configuration changes.


## How Does the Web Work?

Many books can be written about how the web works. 
This book will not cover those specifics.

The important concept for us is to understand how the web works relative to consumers of web applications.
That is to say if I make a web application, how does the web enable my users to consume my product?

As we've covered, the Internet is a network of computers.
All computers in the network can send and receive information.
**Servers** serve up content to the your customers, the end users.

The medium with which an end-user interacts with your web content is called **The client**

Let's visualize this relationship:

        [client]  [client]  [client]
          |         |          |
      -------------------------------- Internet
          |          |            |
      [Server]    [Server]     [Server]



## The Client

We've covered the importance of understanding the different physical environments applications run on.

Traditionally, if you wanted to run an application on your Windows laptop, you had to download Windows
compatible software. If you had a mac you have to get the mac version.

Today we have the internet. One of the best things about the internet is that
it provides a cross-environment **Client interface** to access anything available online.

This client is known as the **Web Browser**. 

A web browser exists on:

- Windows computers
- Mac computers
- Linux computers
- iphone mobile devices
- android mobile devices
- ipad tablets
- android tablets

Each of these devices also has a "device specific" application platform. These are known as "apps"
For example Apple has a mac OSX "app store" where you can download software for your computer.
The client in this case would be your mac OSX operating system.
iphone, android, and ipad all have installable apps that work separate from the web browser but can still use the Internet.

All of these are different clients, different mediums that a user can potentially access your application from.

Because they all leverage they Internet, they can all be thought of as **Web Applications** consumed by various web-enabled **Clients**

Programming an app for all these damned scenarios sounds pretty intense.
Well it is, but modern strategies are pretty cool - it's what you are about to learn.

      [desktop app]  [iphone]  [ipad]  [web browser]
        |         |          |
    ------------------------------------------------ Internet
        |          |            |
    [Server]    [Server]     [Server]


## The Server

Web applications physically exists on the servers. 
The servers are connected to the internet and provide public accessibility via their domain name. 
When you pay for "hosting" you renting space on the server that is connected to the internet.

When you go to google.com you are making a web request to the server IP that is mapped to the domain name google.com
The server sends back a response and the client processed the response into a human readable result.


# Web Application Design

In our last diagrams we exposed the relationship between **client**, **Internet**, and **Server**
We learned the roles of each component: the servers provide the application to the various clients via the Internet.
Now we'll learn _how_ that happens.
  
## Backend

The "backend" is a developer term used to describe all the **server** related components of a web application.
You will soon discover that modern web applications use _many_ servers applied in a wide range of configuration formats.

The backend is responsible for serving up the necessary content that is required to run your web application.
This content may consist of:

- media
  Images, videos, music files, pdfs, downloadable media documents
  can all be sent over the internet to available clients.
- text/html/css
- data (json/xml)
- code (javascript)

## Frontend

The "frontend" is a developer term used to describe all the **client** related components of a web application.
When the backend sends data to the client, it is the client's job to _process and render_ this data into what the end-user sees.

This book will focus on the Web Browser as it's primary client.

When media such as images, audio, video, and documents are sent to a web browser
the browser either displays them, streams them or makes them available for direct download.

Primarily a web browser renders web pages. Web pages consists of

- media files (images)
- HTML with textual content providing structure.
- CSS used to aesthetically style and layout the web page
- javascript - programming instructions capable of executing on the client end.
- raw data

All five types of information are responsible for making a modern web application.


When a client makes a web request to a domain, the request is actually _many requests_.
Some pages send html, some css, images, javascript etc.
All the web requests feed into the main web "document".
You can think of the Document as your application canvas. The document builds 
its environment using the content it receives from all its web requests.


As you can see lot's of stuff is happening here, lot's of data is getting sent over the Internet.
Your app backend is responsible for sending a wide range of data to multiple types of clients throughout the internet.
It sounds like it can get out of hand pretty easily.

We need to design a sane strategy for dealing with so many things going on.

## Bridge (Application Programming Interface)

The "bridge" is not a formal developer term.
The bridge is meant to describe how exactly the **Backend** manages to integrate
in a reliable way with the **client**. The bridge is largely conceptual.

The technical term for this much needed integration point is something you will hear a lot.
It is called the web application's **API** or application programming interface.

  - your other applications (mobile)
  - third party backend/frontend
