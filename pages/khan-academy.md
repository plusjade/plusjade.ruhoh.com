# Notes on learning the khan Academy exercises platform.

## Purpose

I aspire to work for Khan Academy because I believe in Open and Free information 
which is a pre-requisite of Open and Free Education.

A recommended part of the application process is to contribute an exercise so 
I will document my journey in learning the platform because it is true;

Paradoxically the more you learn about a subject the harder it is to teach the subject
because you have less of the insight necessary to view the the subject _as a beginner would_.

For a teacher, it is vital that we empathize with the student.

## Background

I have no prior experience with the Khan Academy platform. 
I have watched a couple videos but I have never been a user.

However I am an experienced web-developer with multiple full-stack projects under my belt 
so I expect to get up to speed reasonably quickly.

## Starting

I am presented with the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/wiki).

I have a problem with wikis because although they can be comprehensive they are very rarely organized and user-friendly.

User-friendliness, to me, is all about _flow_. When reading or learning about any topic, it is very important for each piece to 
flow into the next. I understand this is very hard. Wikis are not particularly good at that because their navigational structure is almost always on a separate page so you get continually back and forth motions.

Without _flow_ there is no cohesion of concepts so with wikis, the M.O. is usually to just do a broad exploration stroke,
then come back and consciously try to make sense of what you just discovered.

Admittedly I had to this. I have no idea what khan-exercises is for, how it works, and why it works that way.
I am a big fan of conceptual overviews. I want to have a context around the stuff I'm reading.

This can be as simple as:

^ The Khan-Exercises repository is what powers the exercise platform on khan academy.
^ This platform is powered primarily by javascript ..asdkfad..

So now that I've figured out the basis of what khan-exercises is, what it does, and _how_ it does it.

I can start.
